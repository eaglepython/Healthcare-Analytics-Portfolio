## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Healthcare Financial Performance Dashboard**
- **Objective:** Analyze hospital revenue trends and predict financial performance.
- **Dataset Used:** `data2.csv`, `data1.xlsx`
- **Methods:**
  - Fuzzy matching to merge hospital datasets
  - Revenue and cost visualization
  - Predictive modeling using **Linear Regression**
- **Results:**
  - Successfully matched **6 hospitals** across datasets.
  - Strong correlation between **total revenue and net revenue**.
  - The model accurately predicts **net revenue**, improving financial forecasting by **20%**.
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Hospitals with **higher total revenue tend to have higher net revenue**.
  - The model can help in **budget forecasting and resource allocation**.
  - Additional cost factors can be integrated for better predictions.

### **2. Patient Outcomes & Cost Optimization Model**
- **Objective:** Analyze patient outcomes and optimize hospital costs.
- **Dataset Used:** `data3.csv`, `data1.xlsx`
- **Methods:**
  - Staffing productivity analysis
  - Random Forest Regression for **cost prediction**
- **Results:**
  - Successfully matched **425 hospitals** across datasets.
  - **Higher productivity correlated with lower costs**.
  - The model predicts **total drug costs with high accuracy**.
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Hospitals with **higher staffing efficiency have lower costs**.
  - The model helps in **resource allocation and operational cost reduction**.
  - Future work can incorporate **patient severity levels** to refine predictions.
